# AncestreeGP

Proof-of-concept method of visualising family medical history in the form of a family tree network.
This was created by John Williams, Lucy Porte, Kimanthi Nyota, Melvin David, Marco Fung and Joshua Haria on 12-13th October 2024 for NHS Hack Day, at Chelsea and Westminster hospital. 

## Problem
Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain information relating the individual patients' family history of disease. 
However, this information is sparse, often inaccurate and does not convey the "closeness" of family members (first/second/ect degree) to the patient in question. 

## Solution
The **AncestreeGP** demo provides an interactive way to visualize family trees, emphasizing relationships between relatives and highlighting hereditary risks. By offering a clear view of first-, second-, and third-degree connections, it allows healthcare providers and patients to better understand potential health risks rooted in family history.

The app is designed to:
- Display family trees with an intuitive network view.
- Highlight degrees of separation between individuals.
- Provide insights into hereditary risks (e.g., genetic predispositions).
- Support better clinical decision-making by visualizing familial patterns of disease.

The **AncestreeGP** demo aims to bridge the gap between scattered EHR data and comprehensive family medical history, empowering clinicians and patients alike to make more informed decisions.
