Proof-of-concept method of visualising family medical history in the form of a family tree network.
This was created by John Williams, Lucy Poole, Kimanthi Nyota, Melvin David, Marco Fung and Joshua Haria on 12-13th October 2024 for NHS Hack Day, at Chelsea and Westminster hospital. 

## Problem
Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain information relating the individual patients' family history of disease. 
However, this information is sparse, often inaccurate and does not convey the "closeness" of family members (first/second/ect degree) to the patient in question.
